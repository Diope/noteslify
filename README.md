# Noteslify

Despite the name this will have nothing to do with Netlify. This is a simple CRUD app for taking notes. The app itself is inconsequential, the purpose of this is mostly to continue learning and improving my AWS skills.

I'll be utilizing AWS Amplify to setup and deploy a serverless GraphQL app. Again the focus on this was learning AWS Amplify/Amplify-CLI not the app itself, I didn't want to get bogged down with feature creep as I tend to do.

The styling are also very basic.
